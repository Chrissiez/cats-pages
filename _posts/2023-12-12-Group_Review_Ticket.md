## Chrissie's Review


## Sreeja's Review
- In the project the main thing I worked on was the Binary translator: In this I created the Binarytotext function and the TexttoBinary functions, I also added the shift button which when clicked switches all the zeros to ones and the ones to zeros
- The next thing that I worked on was the SASS for the page, with this we struggled to get a consolidated theme going throughout the pages. However, we did get it up and running by creating a black text box, white background and a centered text in style.scss file
