## Chrissie's Review
- I made the color shifter using binary shift

## Sreeja's Review
- In the project the main thing I worked on was the Binary translator: In this I created the Binarytotext function and the TexttoBinary functions, I also added the shift button which when clicked switches all the zeros to ones and the ones to zeros
- The next thing that I worked on was the SASS for the page, with this we struggled to get a consolidated theme going throughout the pages. However, we did get it up and running by creating a black text box, white background and a centered text in style.scss file
- My key commits was for the binary translator, as well as for the style.scss
- however, one thing that still isn't working is my make so what I would do is I would try it out on my individual page and then add the code into a google doc and then they would review and add it into the group page.
