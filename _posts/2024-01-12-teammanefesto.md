#### Learn about chemical Elements and their periodic weigth through a fun simple game

## Different portions of the project

Sreeja: Front end- Scrum Master-she will work on creating the ideation of the project this means the way that the elements merge and the sound effects it will create

Tanvi- Front end- she will work on the background and each time the elements merge the background will change color until reaching the final destination where confetti will fall 

Chrissie- Back End- Will work on the actual API code since we will get a template from an online game called watermelon merge 

Aby- Back End-  Dev Ops.- Will work on the login code and how to save high scores and the information of the users

## Our project

This game will basically be like the watermelon merge game where you start from the smallest element like hydrogen and then you have to get to the largest element Neon with 10 levels
