## our plan



Hacks:

Data, Data Structures, Algorithm, and Visualization work together. Data helps supply an interests/topic to an algorithm. It will be expected that you build topics above into your team mini project.

This project will be two weeks long and will incorporate Ideation, Design, Feature Implementation, Integration, Test Complete phases.
Add “Science” into your process*** (research, jupyter notebook, and ultimately running application)
Topics used for teaching, not listed in this blog need to be approved by Teacher.
Topics need to focus on data ideas from Unit 2 of AP Classroom.
Visualization require style using GitHub Pages Theme techniques (SASS)
